# Triangle Keypoints Dataset

This is a the most basic dataset you can use for keypoint localization tasks. I created this dataset for experimenting on doing keypoint localization using deep learning.

The dataset consists of 1000 images of a triangle on a 512x512 image.

You can download the dataset from this link: [TODO LINK](https://a.b)
